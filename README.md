## Summary

The article explores the impact of various parameters (solar potential, electricity prices, battery size, seasonal effects, etc.) on the performance and benefits of V2H systems. A comparative analysis is carried out using a custom simulation tool, with case studies for France, Slovenia, Greece, and other countries.
