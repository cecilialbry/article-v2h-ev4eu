# Scientific Article – V2H and EV4EU Project

This repository contains the scientific article written as part of my internship, focusing on the modeling and simulation of Vehicle-to-Home (V2H) energy scenarios across different European countries involved in the EV4EU project.

## Contents

- `article_v2h.pdf` – Final version of the article (June 2025)
- `article_v2h.docx` – Editable version (Word format)
- `figures/` – Graphs and diagrams used in the article (optional)
- `data/` – Input datasets or simulation results (optional)
- `old_versions/` – Archived drafts or previous versions (optional)

## Summary

The article explores the impact of various parameters (solar potential, electricity prices, battery size, seasonal effects, etc.) on the performance and benefits of V2H systems. A comparative analysis is carried out using a custom simulation tool, with case studies for France, Slovenia, Greece, and other countries.
